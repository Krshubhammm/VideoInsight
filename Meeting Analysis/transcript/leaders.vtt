<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Only 70 I serve the transcript towards the end to all of you.</v>

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.460
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>I mean a couple of times I tried.</v>

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.320
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>It was amazing the way it created the meeting transcript was amazing.</v>

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.200
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>I shared this towards the end of the call.</v>

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.140
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>OK.</v>

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.300
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Yeah, yeah.</v>

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.240
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>The copilot can also help in PowerPoint retrain, so we'll all have access to it training, OK.</v>

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.980
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Uh, we have a limited licenses.</v>

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>OK.</v>

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.920
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>If if you need a new A copilot license, please let your leaders know.</v>

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.510
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>So that's now, they'll coordinate with me.</v>

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>OK, OK, sure.</v>

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.930
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>It's not free though it it doesn't come free with office it it's an additional license that we need to buy.</v>

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>OK.</v>

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>OK, session.</v>

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>OK.</v>

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.520
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So quickly right now we have a slight modification to the existing leave policy here.</v>

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>All know that we have different types of leaves that we have, right?</v>

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Previously and privileged Nashville mostly we have and we have only.</v>

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.340
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>That is based on the tenure of a person and we have wedding leave for a person who's getting wedded and going.</v>

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>And we also have maternity leave and all that.</v>

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:40.910
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So in this what we thought of doing is we anyways have this disconnect by majority of our clients at the end of the year and sometimes we are, you know not left with any big you know work also at the end of the year.</v>

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So we we actually spend idle time.</v>

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:52.210
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So instead we thought that we allocate maybe four days for that, which means we'll give like like option for today.</v>

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>We have a bunch of list of holidays that we have out of that we choose right.</v>

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.970
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Similarly, we'll go with 6 + 4.</v>

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Six would be the privilege leave and the four will be allocated for this one.</v>

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So what happens is that six we have the choice to look at whichever days that we want to choose.</v>

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:22.040
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>In this four, we have six days options that will be given two days in November and another four days in December.</v>

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.650
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Out of the six days we could choose any of the four days and we could go with that.</v>

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So that is what we thought we'll plan with.</v>

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So we will modify, you know, Zoho also accordingly and we will notify you there will be any email communication also that will come to you all around this.</v>

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.690
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Go ahead, but the.</v>

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.600
<v Parthiban Chinnakkannan>So you did.</v>

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:52.090
<v Parthiban Chinnakkannan>Does it mean that we will have a reduced sick leave options for individuals in the year?</v>

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.210
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>No, no, no, no.</v>

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.880
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Actually we have 22 PTO's right in the year are leaving the holidays alone.</v>

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.790
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>You have 22 PDO, K12 casual leaves and 10 privilege and Wellness leaves.</v>

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.090
<v Parthiban Chinnakkannan>Uh.</v>

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.170
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>OK, 12 earned leaves are earned leaves.</v>

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>We call them as earned leaves.</v>

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.160
<v Parthiban Chinnakkannan>Yeah.</v>

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Parthiban Chinnakkannan>So yeah, it it it's actually prorated base it gets added if I'm not wrong, yeah.</v>

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>I mean, I'm don't know what the hell.</v>

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.850
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Yeah, I'm talking, talking about the whole year.</v>

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.470
<v Parthiban Chinnakkannan>OK.</v>

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.780
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Like for the entire year, you have 12 and leave and 10 no privileged bar Wellness leave.</v>

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.070
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>OK.</v>

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.640
<v Parthiban Chinnakkannan>OK.</v>

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:34.440
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Last year it was mentioned that's privileged bar Wellness leave OK, which means the entire 22 days like we can choose whenever we want.</v>

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.890
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>OK, it's up to us to choose when when we want to take that leave now we are kind of bringing it.</v>

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>A slight modification to that where 18 days no employees can choose.</v>

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>OK, we can choose whenever we want.</v>

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.950
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>All those 18 days?</v>

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>OK, four days will be.</v>

00:03:51.690 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>You still have an option, but you have a a limited option where we define certain optional no Wellness holidays and that six days has four days has to be confined within that six Wellness, no optional holidays.</v>

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>So that's going to be 2-2 days in Thanksgiving and another four days in towards the end of the year, between Christmas and New Year.</v>

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:29.070
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>OK, so you can choose any four days within the 60 optional leaves, holidays, OK, rest 18 days.</v>

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.860
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>It's up to the employees to choose.</v>

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.020
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>We are not, you know, putting any limitations there or not putting any boundaries there.</v>

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Ashok KJ>It's really just from from most of the people who work on, at least in in in our projects, right.</v>

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.260
<v Ashok KJ>I think we work all the all those weeks as well.</v>

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>OK.</v>

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:58.350
<v Ashok KJ>So I think having that kind of boundary making us to only fit there, right, I think leaving it as as today is helpful for teams like us.</v>

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.250
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>So yeah, yeah, we know.</v>

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>We know this high.</v>

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>I expected this question, so you if you happen to work on those, if you kind of have to work on all those six days or if you were not able to, you know, avail no part or the entire four days leave, then you can claim a comp off.</v>

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>OK, compound will be paid.</v>

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:26.250
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>You can either choose to pay get paid for those days, or you can carry forward that as a comp off to the next year or whenever you want.</v>

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Ashok KJ>OK.</v>

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>OK, if you happen to work on this.</v>

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Like.</v>

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:42.110
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Like.</v>

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:47.400
<v Prashantkumar sharma>And and not not only not only to this any, just just to add on Ashok's point, even I was like coming to that only because this fits very well if you're talking about widely Deloitte projects right, because we know those are the set down times, but if we consider non delight right, which is like major person right now maybe across data we see.</v>

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.360
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Umm.</v>

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.860
<v Prashantkumar sharma>So that's where we'll have to see because let's say if we give that option and let's say entire team goes on leave, I mean, we'll have to plan better.</v>

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Prashantkumar sharma>That's that's the bottom line.</v>

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.120
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Thank you. Like.</v>

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.360
<v Prashantkumar sharma>Like we have to make sure in advance that you all don't go like let's say we talk about Annex Cloud or Vecna and all.</v>

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.280
<v Prashantkumar sharma>Let's say if everybody plans, because.</v>

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.430
<v Prashantkumar sharma>OK.</v>

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Prashantkumar sharma>That is the four days I want to choose, then, then obviously product will be a problem.</v>

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.950
<v Prashantkumar sharma>So yes.</v>

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:15.330
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>I mean, if people are kind of taking that as an informed believe, we cannot do much that say the whole purpose of that leave is Wellness.</v>

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>OK, unless there is a crushing need.</v>

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>So when we plan our deliveries, we need to plan deliveries in a way that we allow people to take those videos, OK.</v>

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:34.860
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>And and if that did not happen, and if there is a due to some contingency if we were, if we have a she need to work on those days, then compound is the next option.</v>

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.940
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>OK, so basically the idea is for people to take a break.</v>

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>OK, so we need to plan our deliveries accordingly concerning those four or six days as optional holidays and you know move forward.</v>

00:06:52.260 --> 00:07:03.390
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>And customers also most US or any Western customer or even these days no Middle East and Singapore customers are also kind of concerned there is a quite period, OK.</v>

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:10.170
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>So if you tell them that it's going to be a a quite period, our Wellness time, they will also agree to it.</v>

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.650
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>OK.</v>

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.200
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Just that we need to plan our deliveries accordingly.</v>

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:26.070
<v Prashantkumar sharma>OK, my my only point was he maybe rather than just two, maybe our team can do more research like maybe for for APAC reason we know the Chinese New Year is the time where they all go on a leave.</v>

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:33.830
<v Prashantkumar sharma>So that kind of option we know for a Middle East, it's a either type which is that kind of period where like entire week or three or four is gonna have.</v>

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Umm.</v>

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:45.400
<v Prashantkumar sharma>So rather than just considering the Thanksgiving N and the Christmas, maybe we can think of like putting this kind of bucket like two more buckets for for maybe kind of reasons we support.</v>

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:46.700
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Yeah.</v>

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.310
<v Prashantkumar sharma>So that might maybe the more more balance but but yeah, I'm.</v>

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:50.330
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Chief, we will.</v>

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.860
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>We will check that out to soon.</v>

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:52.930
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>We'll check that out.</v>

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.030
<v Prashantkumar sharma>Yeah. Thanks.</v>

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:00.670
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>But did you?</v>

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:02.950
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Sure, she don't.</v>

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.590
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>You wanna speak on, OK?</v>

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Did metrics.</v>

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.780
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>I'm sure so.</v>

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.210
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Thank you.</v>

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.820
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>On hackathon, what do they want to?</v>

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.540
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Yeah, Hackathon is a major topic.</v>

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.070
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>We have.</v>

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:23.950
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>So W A-Team like we have come to a final stage out of 22 for resistance, 19 were able to successfully.</v>

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:32.810
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Don't know work with the team able to get their MVP going and towards the final lap of their work.</v>

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:47.050
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>I think 14 of them were able to submit even we kind of a lot of give a grace time and encouragement and support from the outside so able to have 14 and let's as part of this code Jeannie Hackathon initiative.</v>

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>So out of this 1418 demos evaluation demo have been completed, so as of today we are planning for remaining 6 to happen next week.</v>

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.380
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>There were a lot of interesting use cases being dealt by our team.</v>

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>I think once we have this concluded, they will present the data with you and solutions team as well as the are you know branding team can also make use of it.</v>

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:22.450
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>They're planning for either outside or inside the, so all hands meeting we would like to felicitate the winners as well as talk some nice stories from this code.</v>

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.830
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Jeannie, with all of you over a town hall meeting.</v>

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:35.050
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>So we will plan it ahead and then give you a heads up a week or two so that you also can participate and encourage their fellow Canadians who took their effort here.</v>

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:41.210
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>And of course, we can appreciate the fellow organizers for towards this code GENNING.</v>

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:47.920
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>And this time we have a very interesting and little higher number on from awards point of view.</v>

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:58.880
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>So we'll have that announced and we are thinking to introduce not just the top three winners, probably you know best presenter best who followed the guidelines.</v>

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:10.200
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Lot of other categories are trying to introduce or to I'm of kind of ideate and then get the approval from the team and then we will circulate over a town hall meeting in a few weeks from now.</v>

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.680
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>So that's one good traction.</v>

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:19.020
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>I think we see a lot of new things been used and a lot of learnings have happened out of this thing.</v>

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.780
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Team have taken help from not just the contestants.</v>

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:30.720
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Also, the outside of their team, and like BSA QAS and architects, they kind of had a borrowed time from a learning point of view.</v>

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.550
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>I think it's a good to see witness all those things happened on the floor.</v>

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.600
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>That's a good update you like to Mom.</v>

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.120
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Ashar has Vijay mentioned one, another aspect is skill set matrix.</v>

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.120
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>We'll be running a campaign.</v>

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.000
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>It's a as you know, it's a continuous effort once in two or three months.</v>

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:53.300
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>It's always better that our we encourage our team members to go back to their Zoho check on this skillset.</v>

00:10:53.310 --> 00:11:02.080
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>If they have upgraded their skill from one to other proficiency or acquired a new skill, or acquire a new certification, it's better to update in ZOHO.</v>

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.380
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>As you know, most of us take rely on so for various inputs.</v>

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:15.190
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>A right from aligning a person to a different project or upskilling them or skilling to a new role or whatnot like so.</v>

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:24.600
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>It's really important, so please kind of urge your team to revisit their social profile once in two months is much, much recommended.</v>

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.980
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>We will definitely run our campaigns.</v>

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:34.980
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Do our due diligence to follow up with them, but we need your help to, you know, including your skill sets as well as your team member skill sets.</v>

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.250
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Yeah, that's those are two major updates.</v>

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.420
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>So we have here this point.</v>

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:45.770
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>I'm good with.</v>

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.000
<v Sudha Ganesh>She don't, vinit.</v>

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:51.460
<v Sudha Ganesh>The final a date final final extended date for hackathon closure.</v>

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.130
<v Sudha Ganesh>No.</v>

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:58.610
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>A torture is I've done Sudha out of 14 finalists, 88 demos, the evaluation demos there them.</v>

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Sudha Ganesh>No, I'm sorry, the announcement of the final evaluations.</v>

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>OK, so it should be in the week of 12th February or 19th February.</v>

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.680
<v Sudha Ganesh>OK, fine.</v>

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.030
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>So the yeah, yeah.</v>

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.520
<v Sudha Ganesh>But OK, one point on this skillset matrix that Sriram was mentioning.</v>

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.170
<v Sudha Ganesh>Ohh, let me, let me tell you where the pain point that we currently have.</v>

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:24.810
<v Sudha Ganesh>When we started the skill set matrix, I think even 2-3 years back it was as part of onboarding we you are supposed to.</v>

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:32.990
<v Sudha Ganesh>Everybody's supposed to update their skill sets and whenever they're upskilling our cross skilling we are encouraging them to go back and update it.</v>

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.150
<v Sudha Ganesh>Now as part part of the bench, we have also come up with a Zoho bench module.</v>

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.350
<v Sudha Ganesh>Most of you might be knowing it and maybe using it also as the recent example.</v>

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.880
<v Sudha Ganesh>There were a couple of opportunities for mobile application developer.</v>

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:49.130
<v Sudha Ganesh>Uh.</v>

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.390
<v Sudha Ganesh>And GT meant two and sales team went to the bench.</v>

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.550
<v Sudha Ganesh>We did not have any any mobile developers with Kotlin experience, Java and Kotlin experience right?</v>

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.430
<v Sudha Ganesh>That was not updated in the skill set, so it was not reflecting in the bench.</v>

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:12.200
<v Sudha Ganesh>But then when we discussed our, interacted with the resources, then we got to know that they got Kotlin, but by default we assumed that the skill set is not updated.</v>

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.560
<v Sudha Ganesh>So we thought we don't have resources.</v>

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.430
<v Sudha Ganesh>So we were actually going ahead and hiring in the market, right?</v>

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.380
<v Sudha Ganesh>Also, there are a couple of, I mean not couple many of them.</v>

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:33.760
<v Sudha Ganesh>They mentioned themselves as from back end developers, but then their skill sets are updated as front end developer so there's so much of discrepancies, so it's very important for the team for the RMG team, for the talent delivery team to deploy the people in the right projects.</v>

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.240
<v Sudha Ganesh>The skills that has to be updated properly, that's #1 #2.</v>

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:50.700
<v Sudha Ganesh>Whenever we are working on any proposals in RFPs, we normally project what the organization capabilities are right in terms of product, in terms of technology, in terms of domain, whatever, right?</v>

00:13:51.230 --> 00:14:03.120
<v Sudha Ganesh>So for that also we need some data points to understand how many people are agile certified, how many people are reacting E 0 or react to E3 developers right?</v>

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:15.170
<v Sudha Ganesh>We want to know that so that we can project that as a good organization capability and that actually gives us many brownie points if we project it in that way and we are struggling a lot in order to come up with that.</v>

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:26.250
<v Sudha Ganesh>But we know as an organization of, I mean 1000 member eight, 800 member organization, we have so many expertise, but we are not able to collect it as a report and project it.</v>

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:33.150
<v Sudha Ganesh>So it's very important that we update our skill sets and every time whenever we are up, we are up skilling our graph killing.</v>

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.320
<v Sudha Ganesh>Let's ensure we go ahead and update it and so.</v>

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.460
<v Sudha Ganesh>Let's uh please make it as a as a practice to all your teams and cascade it.</v>

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:51.730
<v Sudha Ganesh>And this is going to be taken for all their career growth, for their promotion recommendations for everything.</v>

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.660
<v Sudha Ganesh>OK, for this is going to be a very important parameter going forward.</v>

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:01.470
<v Sudha Ganesh>Yeah.</v>

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:01.860
<v Sudha Ganesh>Yeah, I'm good.</v>

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:08.250
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>And so that just to thank you for the for adding that point, I'm, I'm just thinking one more leading aspect to cover here and also take your input.</v>

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.390
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>So as you know, all of us know, like right now the skill set matrix is little exhaustive.</v>

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:23.240
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Obviously we can't restrict, but at the same time when it comes to sales pitch or organization capability, matrix pitch always, we won't rely on primary skills, right?</v>

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.330
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>And then also good know the secondary skills.</v>

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:33.200
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>So right now, since we don't have a direct capability in kind of message capability, the fields I'm talking about are the form.</v>

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.580
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>So we wanna take a report from skill set matrix.</v>

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:43.000
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Whoever the the skills are tagged as three and four in terms of proficiency 3 and four are the maximum.</v>

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:49.220
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>The higher end of it, so consider them as a primary, and then whichever is one and two can be of secondary.</v>

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:53.640
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>So that's one smart way of leveraging the existing data at the same time.</v>

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.770
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Not too much, you know, take time to generate a report.</v>

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:01.940
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Of course, if there any changes to that, we can always do it.</v>

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:08.930
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>But do you wanna take that approach so that we also in parallel build some primary and secondary skills data of our resources?</v>

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:14.610
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>We're also gonna kickstart that effort very soon so that this means.</v>

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:22.970
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Again, we're gonna rely on skill set matrix data with people as long as they can keep that up to date along with certification standings completed.</v>

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:28.520
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>It's a lot more helpful for us to take some meaningful and actionable data from that.</v>

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:35.650
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>I'm good.</v>

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.100
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>That she don't.</v>

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:36.640
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>So the anything?</v>

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.310
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Yeah, I'm good.</v>

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:37.630
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Busy.</v>

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Sriram Muthusubramanian>Thank you.</v>

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:41.940
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Yeah.</v>

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:53.210
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So one of The thing is we've been talking about this time sheets and all that right this last month also we had closed about 12 people until the payroll date.</v>

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.750
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>They had not even filled one day of timesheet.</v>

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:03.050
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So you're like for you to kind of, we had to remind them all just before running payroll, we had to remind them.</v>

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.460
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So it gets a little difficult.</v>

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:21.480
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>I hope each one of us or approving the you know, regularizations or the time sheets on time, at least on a weekly basis, that they kind of help us to consolidate a little better than pushing everything till the month end.</v>

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.300
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So that'll be a really, really great help, right?</v>

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:31.940
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So you want to get a little more organized there, so that will kind of help us across the org, right?</v>

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:39.110
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>PMO team is also behind us to kind of ensure that this is something that really helps them right.</v>

00:17:39.500 --> 00:18:01.030
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So any any challenges that you face there, both this time tracking and which is our attendance and timesheets or two standalone things, all of us are aware right because some of the employees also reached out saying that we thought there is a dependency and all that both are independent and we had been constantly sending reminders on that.</v>

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.050
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>I hope all of us are in the same page there, right?</v>

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.070
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Camping Smitty silent.</v>

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.210
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>OK, so this is something that I just want to reiterate here.</v>

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.060
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>That's about it.</v>

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.280
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>But now it's open to all of you.</v>

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.570
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>All you have any questions, we can go ahead.</v>

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:28.590
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>Yeah, I mean, we can manage this.</v>

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:35.800
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>Can insist in the scrum call because when few people reach out to me, they say that they have been maybe like the emails are sending out to them which they miss out.</v>

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:40.540
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>But even the managers and their one of the scrum call right and all of the meeting in the weekends.</v>

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:41.770
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>I think they can insist on this.</v>

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.400
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>It looks like that is not happening.</v>

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.540
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>I didn't sending weekly reminders.</v>

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.830
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Also Shiva, it's there in the calendars.</v>

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:49.470
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>Yeah, maybe you reminder.</v>

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:53.060
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>Yeah, yeah, I I said that weekly money is being sent on top of it.</v>

00:18:53.070 --> 00:19:02.990
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>Maybe like managers can also like talk to them in one of this printer calls to them because like I think few of them are not seeing email even that is I'm not sure what to do with them.</v>

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.630
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>Few, like, they're not seeing emails as well.</v>

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:10.620
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>So maybe like managers, you know, one of their scrum calls, they can insist on this and think that is about right.</v>

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.810
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>Definitely they will have this habit as problem.</v>

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:15.690
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Yeah.</v>

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:23.240
<v Sudha Ganesh>The guys we should set a very, very strong disciplinary action against people who are not following this basic hygiene.</v>

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.820
<v Sudha Ganesh>OK, this goes back to your delivery process also, right.</v>

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.780
<v Sudha Ganesh>The customers also keeps complaining about this.</v>

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.560
<v Sudha Ganesh>We are not following the basic hygiene.</v>

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:35.150
<v Sudha Ganesh>That same thing is happening in our internal organization compliance as well, right?</v>

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:52.910
<v Sudha Ganesh>If somebody is not able to fill timesheet even one day in spite of sending reminders, blocking your calendars and then PM was sending email, HR, sending emails and in spite of it is managers needs to talk in the scrum calls, you guys really need to set up right precedence there.</v>

00:19:53.460 --> 00:20:01.030
<v Sudha Ganesh>This is not at all acceptable, and then all of us, if forty of us are in this call, we are spending 10 minutes of our time talking about it, right?</v>

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.490
<v Sudha Ganesh>This is totally unacceptable, guys.</v>

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:13.480
<v Sudha Ganesh>Next month onwards, in fact, this month itself, we all, I mean Srini myself, we were discussing and HR had sent an email saying payroll has to be detected, but we just stopped that.</v>

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.980
<v Sudha Ganesh>But if we are going to do this, then definitely I think there is no other point.</v>

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.610
<v Sudha Ganesh>There is no other option for us.</v>

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.050
<v Sudha Ganesh>We have to take some disciplinary action.</v>

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:23.590
<v Sudha Ganesh>That's it.</v>

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:24.800
<v Sudha Ganesh>Just let them know.</v>

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.910
<v Sudha Ganesh>It is very, very basic discipline.</v>

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.570
<v Sudha Ganesh>If we are not able to log our time on what we are doing, we are definitely doing something wrong.</v>

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.800
<v Sudha Ganesh>Let's talk about contractors.</v>

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.120
<v Sudha Ganesh>For them, they will get paid only if they lock the timesheets right.</v>

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.600
<v Sudha Ganesh>They have to send the timesheet in order for them to get paid.</v>

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.550
<v Sudha Ganesh>That's all we have to look at.</v>

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Sudha Ganesh>There are organizations who are even tracking when you are leaving out and when you are going in, right?</v>

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:57.720
<v Sudha Ganesh>We are definitely not want that kind of a culture that is not to track people what they are doing, but it is basically for people to understand how productive they are, right.</v>

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:05.040
<v Sudha Ganesh>And there are organizations who are going with productivity monitoring tools and few of you have suggested that also actually recommended that as well, right?</v>

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.820
<v Sudha Ganesh>We are not going with those things.</v>

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:11.800
<v Sudha Ganesh>All we want is a basic discipline for you to fill your attendance, to fill your timesheet.</v>

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:13.470
<v Sudha Ganesh>That's it.</v>

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:20.030
<v Sudha Ganesh>And if you want HR team to block your calendar, let's block your calendar for everything.</v>

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:27.940
<v Sudha Ganesh>OK, like reminder for you to start from home for us to come to office for us to leave office, if that is what we wanted, let's do that as well.</v>

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.080
<v Sudha Ganesh>Let's send a strong note to your teams, guys.</v>

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:35.660
<v Sudha Ganesh>We can't spend time in talking about that, and it's not here.</v>

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:42.640
<v Sudha Ganesh>Internally, we are spending a lot of time reviewing the triport and then seeing who have not done this and whether we should take action.</v>

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:53.120
<v Sudha Ganesh>Maybe we understand that they are into deliveries, I mean schedules all that is OK, but not spending 5 minutes is not at all acceptable we.</v>

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.320
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Let's not even 5 minutes should it's even less.</v>

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:55.280
<v Sudha Ganesh>Yeah.</v>

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:59.080
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>It's like, no, they can do it from the mobile phone.</v>

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:03.520
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>OK, all they need is over people app on their mobile phone and they just have to.</v>

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:07.880
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>It will take not more than 40 seconds 45 seconds for them to do that.</v>

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.620
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>Everything is preconfigured, they just have to go click and select.</v>

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.990
<v Srinivasan Karunakaran>That's all.</v>

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.120
<v Sudha Ganesh>OK. Yeah.</v>

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.910
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Now it's as simple as that, yeah.</v>

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.230
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>OK.</v>

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.290
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So any query.</v>

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.600
<v Sudha Ganesh>And and yeah, there were challenges.</v>

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.040
<v Sudha Ganesh>People mentioned here timesheet is not approved, attendance is not approved.</v>

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:33.650
<v Sudha Ganesh>So timesheet we have we cannot fill actually PMO team needs that both dependency OK for them to track certain other things.</v>

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:40.480
<v Sudha Ganesh>But just because this is a hindrance, they they removed the dependency because of removing that dependency.</v>

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:45.440
<v Sudha Ganesh>Operationally, they have to spend more time, but they they agreed to do that.</v>

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.980
<v Sudha Ganesh>That's again to help people.</v>

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:55.620
<v Sudha Ganesh>OK, so we have to have that basically and we as an approver we have to approve that attendance very quickly, yeah.</v>

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:00.620
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Thanks, bye.</v>

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.760
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Any other points for discussion?</v>

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:19.670
<v Ashok KJ>Yeah, if if no other topic, I think which which we had a call with the gay team.</v>

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:19.990
<v Ashok KJ>Right.</v>

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.350
<v Ashok KJ>Just just to want to bring their concerns.</v>

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:27.520
<v Ashok KJ>Uh, I think definitely the K2022 is some someone.</v>

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:36.900
<v Ashok KJ>I think it's I think that that call hope which you also felt their unhappiness or the start of dissatisfaction.</v>

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:47.100
<v Ashok KJ>So just we we also had like there are almost everyone having a one to one and the exact same message was passed on to us as well.</v>

00:23:47.110 --> 00:24:00.920
<v Ashok KJ>And we also I think whatever the similar message which you you you told right, I think we also had the similar discussion but just I want to bring that as an concern from the whole team.</v>

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:05.560
<v Ashok KJ>It's not like part like different one person or 2% right?</v>

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:09.400
<v Ashok KJ>It's the whole team is unhappy, so it's just just want to bring it to.</v>

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:17.110
<v Ashok KJ>I'm sure this is this will be definitely discussed in the past and going to be discussed, but just just want to bring everyone's notice here.</v>

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:23.050
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>Or I think Ashok, we can take it offline long.</v>

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.210
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>So then shrini, I think we don't have to spend everybody's time here, right?</v>

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:26.620
<v Ashok KJ>Sure, sure.</v>

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.120

<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>I'll be good.</v>

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.430
<v Sudha Ganesh>Looks like they're the most silent meeting that I have ever joined.</v>

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.490
<v Sudha Ganesh>I mean, especially the Friday meeting this particular meeting.</v>

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>Generally it won't be.</v>

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.740
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>I'm not sure why silent down is.</v>

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:07.730
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>I think they're very tired, so that.</v>

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.110
<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>All good otherwise.</v>

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.880

<v Sivakumar Muniappan>Many of visited here but still they are like that.</v>

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:30.960
<v Divyanshi Gupta>It's an alcohol.</v>

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.130
<v Dhiraj Rote>It's a dark hole.</v>

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.180
<v Ashok KJ>No, no, you won't believe something.</v>

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:32.570
<v Dhiraj Rote>We were in a dark hole.</v>

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:34.260
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>Cool.</v>

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.000

<v Dhiraj Rote>Let's let's meet.</v>

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.720
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>Maybe you are like many of visited here, but it looks like they were in four girls.</v>

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:40.520
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>Are they are not talking to chat like this, they were just came here.</v>

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:40.870
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>That's it.</v>

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.410
<v Ashok KJ>No, she writes the other way.</v>

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:47.190
<v Ashok KJ>I think the team already pinged in a group saying Ashok say hi.</v>

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.660
<v Ashok KJ>At least that's the message I got from from.</v>

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:57.280
<v Prashantkumar sharma>That then it's more serious also because even we are looking for you and we are not able to find it out.</v>

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.400
<v Prashantkumar sharma>So whom you are talking now?</v>

00:26:59.120 --> 00:26:59.250
<v Sudha Ganesh>Hey.</v>

00:26:58.570 --> 00:26:59.870
<v Ashok KJ>And then no, no.</v>

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:02.570
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>It's same thing pressure that you you can catch you only over teams chat not 10%.</v>

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.690
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>If you comes in personal so you don't talk to you, OK?</v>

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:05.820
<v Ashok KJ>No, no.</v>

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:07.450
<v Ashok KJ>If you walked into the boardroom, you would.</v>

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:08.370
<v Aravind Dhandapani>In even in Coimbatore also, he will not say.</v>

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.870
<v Sudha Ganesh>Then you guys really need to find out with whom he's talking.</v>

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:11.860
<v Ashok KJ>Wait.</v>

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.070
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>Uh, yeah, that, that.</v>

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.720
<v Sudha Ganesh>So obviously, Coimbatore team says no Prashant saying no.</v>

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.400
<v Sudha Ganesh>Then I don't know to whom he's talking so.</v>

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.780
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>That is another thing we have to see is.</v>

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.820
<v Aravind Dhandapani>Even in Coimbatore also, he will not.</v>

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:21.790
<v Aravind Dhandapani>He will not, he will say only hi by that's all he will be always on calls, even in Coimbatore.</v>

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:23.270
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>Hmm.</v>

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.310
<v Ashok KJ>I think it's a bad nothing to start in this call today.</v>

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.740

<v Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam>It's better though I live.</v>

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.610
<v Sivakumar Muniappan>I have not even spoken to you actually.</v>

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:35.800
