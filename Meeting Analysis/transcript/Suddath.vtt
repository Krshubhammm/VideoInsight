<v Navinprasad Vijayakumar>Hi, Amanda.</v>

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.160
<v Navinprasad Vijayakumar>Good morning.</v>

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:01.600
<v Sujai Kumar>Having.</v>

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.710
<v Amanda Colon>Good morning.</v>

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.010
<v Sujai Kumar>Uh, I mean the shall we start with the updates?</v>

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.640
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah, let's go ahead and go.</v>

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Amanda Colon>Thank you.</v>

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Sujai Kumar>The basement validation part from our side, we made few changes on Thursday and provided the PBX file and that has been updated by ambit as well.</v>

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Sujai Kumar>And also we did validate a few of the KPI's which you mentioned in your email that that has been validated from our end and we are in the final stage of validation and we would require another 20-30 minutes after this call for us to confirm everything is fine and then we'll upload the updated version and then form that for A to push it to the pre prod environment and we'll let you know once she confirms.</v>

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Sujai Kumar>The refresh is complete.</v>

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.560
<v Amanda Colon>Thank you.</v>

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Sujai Kumar>And.</v>

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Sujai Kumar>On one phase, two have been on the development side.</v>

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Sujai Kumar>It is complete right from our side.</v>

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Navinprasad Vijayakumar>Yes.</v>

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.160
<v Navinprasad Vijayakumar>OK, so we have migrated all the modules like pick up and also delivery tool.</v>

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Navinprasad Vijayakumar>The Azure functions right now since we don't have the connectivity between the DB and the Azure functions.</v>

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:37.340
<v Navinprasad Vijayakumar>Currently we are utilizing Azure storage just to mock the particular environment where we store the CSV and take it for preprocessing 10 for feature engineering and so on.</v>

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.850
<v Navinprasad Vijayakumar>So we are trying to exactly replicate the same and draw from Azure storage for now.</v>

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Navinprasad Vijayakumar>So once we are, once we get the connect connection string for the DB like we'll like try to replace the other storage with the actual DB and everything will look like as as expected.</v>

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.760
<v Navinprasad Vijayakumar>So that's the overall update.</v>

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Navinprasad Vijayakumar>What I got so as of now like the entire workflow from preprocessing till model development is working in Azure functions.</v>

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Sujai Kumar>OK.</v>

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.260
<v Amanda Colon>Did we?</v>

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.420
<v Sujai Kumar>So, Andrew, yeah, sorry you score.</v>

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Amanda Colon>Umm, I know we changed a couple fields like the sources.</v>

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.080
<v Amanda Colon>Are we also making that change and the and the data model too?</v>

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.800
<v Sujai Kumar>Yes.</v>

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Amanda Colon>Or the retraining. OK.</v>

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.900
<v Sujai Kumar>Yeah.</v>

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.070
<v Sujai Kumar>Then yeah, we have done that, so.</v>

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.530
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Amanda Colon>Thank you.</v>

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.790
<v Amanda Colon>Sorry if I missed that.</v>

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.270
<v Sujai Kumar>Yeah, I do.</v>

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Sujai Kumar>I have a request on the status of creating the database access for us.</v>

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Drew Diana>I will.</v>

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.820
<v Drew Diana>I will meeting with the data team.</v>

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.760
<v Drew Diana>I think after this so I'll double check with them.</v>

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.080
<v Drew Diana>I think they started creating it.</v>

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Drew Diana>I'm not sure what the status is right now.</v>

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Sujai Kumar>OK, so you if we get that then then we we can plan to.</v>

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Sujai Kumar>Implement the change with the database into the function app and then well.</v>

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.760
<v Sujai Kumar>We'll start moving it to pretty proud as well for everyone's review.</v>

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.910
<v Drew Diana>OK.</v>

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.930
<v Sujai Kumar>So once that is done, please let us know.</v>

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.580
<v Drew Diana>Yep, we'll do.</v>

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Sujai Kumar>And for the dashboard development of on the EDA insights that has been complete for both pickup and delivery.</v>

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.750
<v Sujai Kumar>Jamal can be present that to the team.</v>

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.960
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah.</v>

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.460
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah, sure.</v>

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.450
<v Sujai Kumar>Yeah.</v>

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.450
<v Jamal Asif>So that let me share my screen.</v>

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.820
<v Sujai Kumar>Yeah.</v>

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.330
<v Jamal Asif>It is feasible, let us know.</v>

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.090
<v Jamal Asif>That my screen is usually.</v>

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.940
<v Sujai Kumar>Yeah, suitable, yes.</v>

00:04:51.350 --> 00:05:00.690
<v Jamal Asif>Ohh, so uh, this is an EDA insights like you know we have already share our PowerPoint presentation.</v>

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:21.590
<v Jamal Asif>What we have got the result in the Edu insights, so the same we have tried to know replicated in our power BI dashboards, OK, so just go through 1 by 1 the dashboards so so if the first first charge is representative, so top five went or based on the pickup.</v>

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Jamal Asif>So the vendor wise, the top pickup count, it's not a pickup point, it's it's a shipment.</v>

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.970
<v Jamal Asif>Shipment happened for the vendor wise.</v>

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.850
<v Jamal Asif>So based on that, we just you know.</v>

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.940
<v Jamal Asif>I'm showing us an insight has top five vendors.</v>

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.200
<v Jamal Asif>At present we are just showing the vendor code.</v>

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Jamal Asif>Is that fine or else so we just want you to showcase the the vendor name because we notice the same vendor code has multiple vendor names.</v>

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.890
<v Jamal Asif>So it means it's not a meaningful to showcase them when their name.</v>

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:06.580
<v Jamal Asif>That is the reason we just showcasing the vendor code is that fine or any other way to showcase the based on the vendor code with some shipment or shipment counts.</v>

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.160
<v Jamal Asif>I just pause here.</v>

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Jamal Asif>If you have any some suggestion to know improve this analysis of the first part of charts, let us know we will ready to do that.</v>

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:30.580
<v Amanda Colon>When you hover over, but any outlet, yeah that there so still just the vendor code pics as listed.</v>

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.840
<v Amanda Colon>It doesn't say the name.</v>

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:39.550
<v Amanda Colon>Are there multiple vendor names, Sherry because of the GMs and the mover suite ID?</v>

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Amanda Colon>Why would there?</v>

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.740
<v Amanda Colon>How could there be multiple names?</v>

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Cheri S Rhodes>No, there's one vendor code, 1 vendor code should have only one name.</v>

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:59.580
<v Cheri S Rhodes>But with I mean, but even with the duplicates it should technic because we we are having some issues with duplicates in the system because of mover suite.</v>

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.180
<v Amanda Colon>Right.</v>

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:05.100
<v Jamal Asif>So.</v>

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Cheri S Rhodes>But it should still have the same name if we're pulling.</v>

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.340
<v Amanda Colon>Right now there could be, yeah.</v>

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:14.370
<v Jamal Asif>The we'll do one thing we just know showcase the name in the tool tip.</v>

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.090
<v Jamal Asif>Let's see how it's some.</v>

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.110
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.600
<v Jamal Asif>These are it's visible.</v>

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.080
<v Jamal Asif>We'll see that.</v>

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.530
<v Cheri S Rhodes>OK.</v>

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.700
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:28.430
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah, I know that there are similar like vendor names like it could.</v>

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.610
<v Amanda Colon>It could be very similar, right?</v>

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.550
<v Amanda Colon>And there to another vendor name.</v>

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.970
<v Amanda Colon>But they're vendor codes are different, so that's the distinction.</v>

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah.</v>

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.890
<v Jamal Asif>Yes, sure.</v>

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.420
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, because it could be different locations, yeah.</v>

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:56.370
<v Amanda Colon>Umm.</v>

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:56.530
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah, we we notice like for a vendor code you 1398 for example if the U1398IS sad that and we notice the same mentor code has a different name as the Sadat Inc in the different row items.</v>

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.670
<v Jamal Asif>So these are all the the name mismatches we found.</v>

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.860
<v Jamal Asif>So that is the reason we just showcasing only based on the vendor code here.</v>

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:12.920
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah.</v>

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:13.780
<v Amanda Colon>From that we may be stuck if if if there are the mismatch is like that.</v>

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.860
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Where are you pulling the name from?</v>

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.430
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Is it from the vendor the the vendor dimension?</v>

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Cheri S Rhodes>The EM vendor.</v>

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.210
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah, the vendor.</v>

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.500
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah, DM vendor.</v>

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.320
<v Jamal Asif>Yes, exactly.</v>

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.060
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, it should be.</v>

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.340
<v Cheri S Rhodes>What?</v>

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.370
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Just the legal name.</v>

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.010
<v Cheri S Rhodes>That should be the field that we pull from.</v>

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:37.620
<v Cheri S Rhodes>I know there it may be called like other things and like other, but I think the the legal name, I think that's what it's called now.</v>

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.420
<v Cheri S Rhodes>I have to look at it because I might be thinking of scacs, yeah.</v>

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.430
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah, I do know.</v>

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.370
<v Amanda Colon>Legal name as part of like stack, but like maybe?</v>

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.670
<v Jamal Asif>So you you meant a column attribute name is legal name.</v>

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Cheri S Rhodes>I think so, but I might be thinking of the scac the **** code because I'm also working on scats and separately.</v>

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.640
<v Sujai Kumar>OK.</v>

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.830
<v Amanda Colon>Can you can you verify which field we should be using? Sherry.</v>

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.640
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, let me.</v>

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.390
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:08.810
<v Cheri S Rhodes>I'm trying to get a vendor.</v>

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:08.850
<v Amanda Colon>Thank you.</v>

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Jamal Asif>Umm centercode.</v>

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:17.580
<v Cheri S Rhodes>It's up.</v>

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.540
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Do you have vendor?</v>

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.120
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yep, Yep.</v>

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.690
<v Cheri S Rhodes>It might just be vendor name.</v>

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.320
<v Jamal Asif>Vendor code and went our name.</v>

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Jamal Asif>I remember that.</v>

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.720
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, maybe it is just vendor name.</v>

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:33.560
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Let me see.</v>

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yep, it's just vendor name.</v>

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.760
<v Cheri S Rhodes>That's all that it says.</v>

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.080
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yep.</v>

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.700
<v Cheri S Rhodes>So that's the name that we should be using.</v>

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:41.840
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Is the vendor name?</v>

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yep, from the vendor table and that, yeah, there will be like multiple ACE relocation systems because they're different.</v>

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.760
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Hmm locations.</v>

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:02.960
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah.</v>

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:12.780
<v Cheri S Rhodes>So you can use vendor name because when we're looking into the table like into the report, they're mostly going to be looking by area.</v>

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:20.510
<v Cheri S Rhodes>I'm sure like the origin and destination areas, and then when that vendor pulls up, they'll know which one it is just.</v>

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.340
<v Jamal Asif>Vendor name.</v>

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:32.670
<v Jamal Asif>So instead vendor code we can use the vendor name or else we just show that tool tip as vendor name.</v>

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Jamal Asif>That is fine.</v>

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.420
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah.</v>

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.350
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Which one do you want, Amanda?</v>

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.740
<v Amanda Colon>Umm, I can only have one vendor code.</v>

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.650
<v Amanda Colon>UM, if, like the way you're hovering now.</v>

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.250
<v Cheri S Rhodes>The bar chart.</v>

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.390
<v Sujai Kumar>That, yeah.</v>

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.070
<v Cheri S Rhodes>OK.</v>

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:53.630
<v Amanda Colon>Like I like the code being in the the the card, the bar chart.</v>

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.160
<v Amanda Colon>Thank you.</v>

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.530
<v Cheri S Rhodes>And then the vendor name to pop up in the tool tip.</v>

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.410
<v Amanda Colon>When you hover it, yes?</v>

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.560
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah. Yep.</v>

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.740
<v Sujai Kumar>Yeah. Yes.</v>

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.440
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah, that is.</v>

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Amanda Colon>If that's possible without it being too complicated, OK.</v>

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.700
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah, that is doable.</v>

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.540
<v Jamal Asif>That is doable.</v>

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.790
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Ohh no, it's super simple.</v>

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.680
<v Jamal Asif>It's not an issue, yeah.</v>

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:05.840

<v Amanda Colon>Yeah.</v>

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.970
<v Jamal Asif>The only changes is we have to include the tool tip of vendor name.</v>

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.210
<v Jamal Asif>OK, so the and.</v>

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:23.200
<v Amanda Colon>Under I just wanna look at the the filters at the top.</v>

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:33.940
<v Amanda Colon>So the does this filter or does the top five in theory could change based off of the performance period we select?</v>

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:34.800
<v Amanda Colon>Is that correct?</v>

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.780
<v Amanda Colon>Do any of the filters at the top?</v>

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:42.040
<v Amanda Colon>Below the data will follow those OK.</v>

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.250

<v Jamal Asif>So yeah, the changes.</v>

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.940
<v Amanda Colon>You know, yeah.</v>

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:04.160
<v Jamal Asif>So the another one is and the pick up time period with most of shipment happened.</v>

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:08.920
<v Jamal Asif>So we just, you know, segregated the shipment type based on the shipment.</v>

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:20.960
<v Jamal Asif>Sorry, shipment count based on the shipment type and the month on month trend, we just showing us so which month we has more shipments happened?</v>

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:24.450
<v Amanda Colon>I was surprised there.</v>

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.650
<v Amanda Colon>I'm so with this.</v>

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.390
<v Amanda Colon>Did which vendor code did you use?</v>

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.700
<v Amanda Colon>So did you use the OA vendor code or the HA vendor code?</v>

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.750
<v Amanda Colon>Which?</v>

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.410
<v Jamal Asif>No you here.</v>

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.760
<v Cheri S Rhodes>They're counting pickup by pickup date, GBL by pickup date.</v>

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.430
<v Amanda Colon>Ohh, just a month, not vendor.</v>

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.240
<v Jamal Asif>Yes.</v>

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.680
<v Amanda Colon>OK, got it. OK.</v>

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.490
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah, it's vendor.</v>

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.590
<v Jamal Asif>It's not included here.</v>

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:53.140
<v Amanda Colon>No worries.</v>

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.010
<v Amanda Colon>We don't need to add it.</v>

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.830
<v Amanda Colon>I I misunderstood what I was thinking.</v>

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.510
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah.</v>

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.510
<v Jamal Asif>So just a shipment type wife shipments.</v>

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.510
<v Amanda Colon>Glasgow domestic loose Q pack.</v>

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.340
<v Amanda Colon>Think have a lot.</v>

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:15.140
<v Jamal Asif>So right now we just showcasing as your account of Gmail number.</v>

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.820
<v Jamal Asif>So instead of count of GBL number we will change it to shipments number of shipments.</v>

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.640
<v Amanda Colon>Now you wouldn't have thought Cube pack would be that much higher in July.</v>

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.370
<v Amanda Colon>Then and van or the.</v>

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.850
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah, because the the colors are changing.</v>

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:43.770
<v Amanda Colon>Signs of money.</v>

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.330
<v Jamal Asif>So the another one is the time period with the most delays.</v>

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:19.310
<v Jamal Asif>Like no, we had segregated the pickup status like moderate delay 10 to 30 days and significant delays beyond 35 days and slide delays.</v>

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.290
<v Jamal Asif>So one to 10 days.</v>

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:27.810
<v Jamal Asif>So based on the segregations, so we just showcasing month on one that and the shipments happened.</v>

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.690
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah, it's.</v>

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.350
<v Cheri S Rhodes>How do you define the delay? What?</v>

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.680
<v Jamal Asif>The based on the plan pickup date and the actual pickup date.</v>

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:43.810
<v Cheri S Rhodes>OK.</v>

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.610
<v Amanda Colon>Umm, that works, yeah.</v>

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:46.750
<v Cheri S Rhodes>OK.</v>

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.860
<v Amanda Colon>The plan data is is what we enter when we do the premise survey.</v>

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.100
<v Amanda Colon>Umm.</v>

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.860
<v Amanda Colon>The the date range, the days, the ranges of the days? Umm.</v>

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.860
<v Amanda Colon>One, as you said, 10 to 30.</v>

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.160
<v Amanda Colon>So I don't know.</v>

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:21.030
<v Amanda Colon>I need to think about how what those ranges would be because.</v>

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:24.990
<v Amanda Colon>Flight 1 to 10.</v>

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.380
<v Amanda Colon>Significant 35.</v>

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.330
<v Jamal Asif>So if you wanted to change the bucket that also it's doable.</v>

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:46.320
<v Jamal Asif>So you just know if there is any changes to segregate the buckets, you just send us an email or.</v>

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:48.970
<v Jamal Asif>Whatever.</v>

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:50.860
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.810
<v Jamal Asif>Just messages how the bucket would be.</v>

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.340
<v Jamal Asif>So we will do it, we'll do the changes based on your.</v>

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:58.020
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:58.530
<v Amanda Colon>Thank you.</v>

00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:59.130
<v Jamal Asif>Together, yeah.</v>

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.110
<v Amanda Colon>Channel and Orange state.</v>

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.940
<v Jamal Asif>Is that fine?</v>

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.860
<v Jamal Asif>Shall I go to the next one?</v>

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:22.330
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah.</v>

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.270
<v Cheri S Rhodes>The time period with most delays is fine.</v>

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.680
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Now the count of vendor by channel and origin state. Hmm.</v>

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.780
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah, that Channel cherry which you shared us the channel.</v>

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:33.830
<v Jamal Asif>So what are?</v>

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.550
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, the regions are at the bottom.</v>

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:42.120
<v Cheri S Rhodes>The destination regions are on the X axis and then the origin states are the the colors and the bar chart shush.</v>

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:44.470
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah.</v>

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.030
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Hmm.</v>

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.210
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Very interesting.</v>

00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:02.700
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah, this ones a little well, I keep looking down to the bubbles, but yeah, that that visual is a little.</v>

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.060
<v Amanda Colon>Umm.</v>

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:08.990
<v Cheri S Rhodes>So this is how many vendors in a chat in a channel.</v>

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.330
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah.</v>

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.490
<v Cheri S Rhodes>I state.</v>

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.770
<v Jamal Asif>The count of vendor by channel.</v>

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.800
<v Jamal Asif>Actually it is count of shipment.</v>

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.210
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Ohh it's shipment count.</v>

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.300
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah, actually we need to rename relabel it.</v>

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:37.840
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.470
<v Jamal Asif>So count of shipment for the origin state for the particular channel.</v>

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.310
<v Jamal Asif>That that will change the name, yeah.</v>

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.340
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Is that helpful to you, Amanda?</v>

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.720
<v Amanda Colon>Umm, I don't know.</v>

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.520
<v Amanda Colon>It could be and I'm just not.</v>

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.810
<v Amanda Colon>There's six.</v>

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.810
<v Amanda Colon>Or do we say Texas?</v>

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:28.820
<v Amanda Colon>OK, from Texas to region six, we had 25133 shipments pick up, is that correct?</v>

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.990
<v Jamal Asif>Yes.</v>

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:31.650
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.230
<v Amanda Colon>And where we've got it all performance periods.</v>

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.630
<v Jamal Asif>Exactly.</v>

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:38.950
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.950
<v Jamal Asif>So if you wanted to change any particular performance period, you will have to.</v>

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.040
<v Amanda Colon>Ohm.</v>

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:48.740
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah.</v>

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:49.080
<v Amanda Colon>When.</v>

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.260
<v Amanda Colon>No, no, that's OK.</v>

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.810
<v Amanda Colon>There we go.</v>

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.930
<v Cheri S Rhodes>That is, it is pretty interesting.</v>

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:54.400
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah, I know.</v>

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.400
<v Amanda Colon>That's why.</v>

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.320
<v Amanda Colon>So yeah, I do think that that will be helpful.</v>

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.670
<v Amanda Colon>So now we're looking at.</v>

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.130
<v Amanda Colon>Vendor code and OK.</v>

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.380
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah, if we just.</v>

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.350
<v Sujai Kumar>Yeah.</v>

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:20.300
<v Amanda Colon>We just change it instead of counting vendor account to shipment or GBL or whatever.</v>

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.840
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah, that works.</v>

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.710
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah, I know that is very interesting.</v>

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:40.440
<v Jamal Asif>OK.</v>

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.980
<v Amanda Colon>I think we can go to the next one.</v>

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:44.860
<v Jamal Asif>You know, ohh.</v>

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:48.530
<v Jamal Asif>This is shipment type based on the weight and the locations.</v>

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Amanda Colon>So pick up state was.</v>

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:09.510
<v Jamal Asif>So shipment type is Alaska and pick up Windows 8 is Alabama and the average of shipment actual weight is 3001 zero 4.76.</v>

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.060
<v Jamal Asif>So Rhoda Georgio India now.</v>

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Jamal Asif>Thanks guys.</v>

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.230
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Is this this?</v>

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.410
<v Amanda Colon>Can you hover on the domestic list?</v>

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.130
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Is this the sum of the way or the average weight?</v>

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.010
<v Jamal Asif>Average.</v>

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.180
<v Jamal Asif>Average of shipment actual weight.</v>

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.830
<v Amanda Colon>You meant hovering over the domestic loose load like the first balloon.</v>

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.830
<v Amanda Colon>I think blue bar.</v>

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.920
<v Amanda Colon>Uh, can we go down to the domestic loose load shipment type?</v>

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:00.510
<v Amanda Colon>Perfect. OK.</v>

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.680
<v Amanda Colon>To pick up from Alabama as 81, OK.</v>

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.040
<v Amanda Colon>Do we go to the Gray?</v>

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.180
<v Amanda Colon>Rhoda, OK.</v>

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:39.920
<v Amanda Colon>Umm, so in the the the key at the top, the last state we see as Kansas, but there was an arrow do we can we click that arrow and it pulls like we can see?</v>

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:41.630
<v Jamal Asif>This one.</v>

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.820
<v Amanda Colon>No up.</v>

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:52.090
<v Amanda Colon>Up in the key where it says Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, like right underwear, the title is where it says shipment, weight and location.</v>

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:53.700
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah.</v>

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:58.480
<v Amanda Colon>So there's Indiana, there's Kansas, but there's a lot more states.</v>

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.150
<v Amanda Colon>So that what we do, OK.</v>

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:01.040
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah.</v>

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:01.790
<v Cheri S Rhodes>OK.</v>

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.380
<v Jamal Asif>So we have your scroll option, is there yeah.</v>

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.660
<v Cheri S Rhodes>We need to use DPS net weight.</v>

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.160
<v Cheri S Rhodes>For that not shipment actually.</v>

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:14.680
<v Jamal Asif>From the DPS?</v>

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:23.210
<v Cheri S Rhodes>It's it's in shipment detail, but it's that's the name of it is DPS net weight.</v>

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:31.480
<v Jamal Asif>So we have the same the similar column is there in the DPS shipment table.</v>

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:32.070
<v Jamal Asif>You mean right?</v>

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:32.880
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Oh yeah.</v>

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:33.600
<v Cheri S Rhodes>DPS shipment?</v>

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:35.120
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, it's probably there too, yes.</v>

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:39.610
<v Cheri S Rhodes>I think.</v>

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:46.860
<v Jamal Asif>So instead of which we using the shipment detail table, we have to use DPS shipment.</v>

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.910
<v Jamal Asif>The same column attributes before that we need to check the column is there or not.</v>

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.030
<v Cheri S Rhodes>OK, let me look and see what's there.</v>

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.970
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Actual act, CT, net weight.</v>

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.450
<v Cheri S Rhodes>That's the column in DPS shipment.</v>

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:04.360
<v Jamal Asif>Eight years.</v>

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.000
<v Cheri S Rhodes>AC T for actual.</v>

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:08.920
<v Jamal Asif>OK.</v>

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.770
<v Cheri S Rhodes>So it'll be, yeah, ACT net weight.</v>

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:15.570
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Umm, the shipment actual way?</v>

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.550
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Is from our core system, so I will not.</v>

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.850
<v Cheri S Rhodes>I don't trust that.</v>

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:26.450
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah.</v>

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:26.970
<v Jamal Asif>OK so.</v>

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:29.870
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah.</v>

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:33.590
<v Amanda Colon>I mean, if there's DPS, if there's data and DPS that's that should always be, we should.</v>

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:41.810
<v Cheri S Rhodes>You have any dates or weights need to come from the DPS data and nothing not from anything that we have internally because it's more human error.</v>

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.480
<v Jamal Asif>OK, so not at all.</v>

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Jamal Asif>So we will change accordingly, Sherry.</v>

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:49.510
<v Cheri S Rhodes>OK.</v>

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.700
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, but that's interesting.</v>

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.100
<v Amanda Colon>So are all the states listed there.</v>

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.340
<v Amanda Colon>That's where our in that card.</v>

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.420
<v Amanda Colon>Even when we use the arrow, I don't think they were all listed.</v>

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:14.300
<v Sujai Kumar>Yeah.</v>

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:19.970
<v Sujai Kumar>My only we have all the States 50 plus instead in this chat.</v>

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.930
<v Sujai Kumar>Or have we districted to 10 nodes?</v>

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.640
<v Jamal Asif>Uh, right now we have restricted for top 10.</v>

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.240
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:39.050
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, I think that's fine because otherwise it's going to get really crazy.</v>

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.810
<v Amanda Colon>Mm-hmm.</v>

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.620
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah, it's look like a clumsy.</v>

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.680
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yes. Yeah.</v>

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.850
<v Jamal Asif>She don't see what are the numbers.</v>

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.070
<v Amanda Colon>OK, at least we understand.</v>

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.930
<v Amanda Colon>Like that's fine.</v>

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:50.380
<v Amanda Colon>It's the top ten that's.</v>

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:56.280
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, I mean, and if you, I mean, at some point in the future, if there's something else, it's easy to change the visual just to pull in something else you wanna see.</v>

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:57.640
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.730
<v Amanda Colon>Got it.</v>

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.510
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah, we can leave this one as is.</v>

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.470
<v Jamal Asif>The same thing come.</v>

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:19.330
<v Jamal Asif>This is based on the vendor, so instead of based on the shipment type, we just showcasing the top five pick up vendor based on shipment weight.</v>

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:29.060
<v Jamal Asif>So here also we will change the shipment actual weight from shipment details too DPS shipment or table.</v>

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:34.670
<v Sujai Kumar>Remind you have doubt.</v>

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.090
<v Sujai Kumar>Top six think we need to change it.</v>

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.490
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah, that will change.</v>

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:46.650
<v Jamal Asif>OK, I'll do that.</v>

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.810
<v Sujai Kumar>OK.</v>

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:52.240
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, that works.</v>

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:53.720
<v Amanda Colon>Umm.</v>

00:25:54.810 --> 00:26:01.920
<v Jamal Asif>So that the another one is the bubble chart represents it's consistency, went out pick up performance.</v>

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.820
<v Jamal Asif>So the top one is W 07590.</v>

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:22.190
<v Jamal Asif>Number of shipment is 228 and the performance so based on the at number of shipments and the top average on time pickup score.</v>

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:28.290
<v Jamal Asif>So this is the one is the first one the the Topper vendor.</v>

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:35.780
<v Jamal Asif>So we'll do include the vendor name in the tool tip here itself.</v>

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.680
<v Jamal Asif>We will do that.</v>

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:37.740
<v Jamal Asif>We'll do the changes here.</v>

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:39.310
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:43.710
<v Cheri S Rhodes>OK, so the size of the bubble is the count shipment count, right?</v>

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.140
<v Jamal Asif>Exactly.</v>

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:45.690
<v Jamal Asif>Exactly.</v>

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:46.210
<v Amanda Colon>Ohh.</v>

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.860
<v Jamal Asif>So based on the shipment.</v>

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:48.890
<v Cheri S Rhodes>OK, said the bigger I was. Yeah.</v>

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:51.980
<v Cheri S Rhodes>So the bigger the bubble, that means the more shipments that they handled.</v>

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.200
<v Jamal Asif>Exactly.</v>

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:53.820
<v Cheri S Rhodes>So and was that so?</v>

00:26:53.830 --> 00:27:00.140
<v Cheri S Rhodes>That means it's a very well performing vendor because they've handled a lot of shipments but they're also have a high score.</v>

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.440
<v Amanda Colon>At 24, yeah.</v>

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:10.520
<v Jamal Asif>So, but this W 01265 it has only number of shipment is 3 so that the bubble size is pretty small.</v>

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.410
<v Amanda Colon>They're not very timely either.</v>

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.500
<v Jamal Asif>So this one is big face, yeah.</v>

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:17.900
<v Amanda Colon>I don't know who that is.</v>

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.670
<v Jamal Asif>The color represents a based on the vendor code the legend names.</v>

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.750
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, interesting.</v>

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:36.570
<v Amanda Colon>So what I like with one of the filters at the top, we could select just a vendor.</v>

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:43.390
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah, vendor code or even a couple. Right?</v>

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Umm.</v>

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.080
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, that's a lot.</v>

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:51.930
<v Amanda Colon>And then we could see more on them, cause right now that's like, Oh my goodness, that's that's a lot of overlapping stuff, but.</v>

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:55.740
<v Amanda Colon>Hmm.</v>

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:58.480
<v Cheri S Rhodes>But yeah, cause mostly I mean you're gonna be looking like by state or by, you know performance period or things like that.</v>

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.870
<v Cheri S Rhodes>So that'll yeah, that will help it.</v>

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:00.910
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah, cool.</v>

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.740
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Oh my gosh, look at that green one.</v>

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.550
<v Jamal Asif>So you you can do, you can do multiple selections also.</v>

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:07.820
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah.</v>

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.430
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Ah, OK.</v>

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.930
<v Jamal Asif>So whatever the vendor code you want, you can select a multiple selections to see the.</v>

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:13.290
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Very cool.</v>

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.230
<v Jamal Asif>Those winter codes informations as well.</v>

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:23.100
<v Amanda Colon>I think maybe yeah.</v>

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:26.290
<v Amanda Colon>Umm do we?</v>

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.810
<v Amanda Colon>Looking at it at a network would probably be helpful too.</v>

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:31.140
<v Amanda Colon>Do we?</v>

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.320
<v Amanda Colon>I know I don't think we've done anything with network anywhere else.</v>

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.780
<v Amanda Colon>Are we tied into that data warehouse?</v>

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.310
<v Amanda Colon>Could they pull that in easily sharing?</v>

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:46.710
<v Cheri S Rhodes>And.</v>

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.200
<v Sujai Kumar>Do you want a filter for network?</v>

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.170
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah.</v>

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.790
<v Amanda Colon>So like the A1 Freeman network or the South Network?</v>

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.890
<v Amanda Colon>Like how to see how they perform, you know overall.</v>

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.250
<v Amanda Colon>And then we would still have the breakdown per state.</v>

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.310
<v Amanda Colon>So that's pretty cool.</v>

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:17.130
<v Amanda Colon>And I know it looks like there's not a lot of real estate at the top to add that filter, but I think that that would, I know Jamie and and Scott Kelly would probably wanna know how the vendors are doing at the network level.</v>

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:23.890
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, that's in the vendor table and it's all it is, just network is the name of the the field.</v>

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:25.420
<v Sujai Kumar>OK.</v>

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.550
<v Sujai Kumar>OK.</v>

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:34.400
<v Amanda Colon>And I think it would be fine just to do it at the top right was a filter.</v>

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:40.530
<v Amanda Colon>We wouldn't necessarily need to worry about doing anything else with the other visuals.</v>

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.730
<v Sujai Kumar>OK.</v>

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:43.210
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:44.790
<v Sujai Kumar>We'll we'll look into it and.</v>

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:46.100
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:48.800
<v Jamal Asif>OK.</v>

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.130
<v Sujai Kumar>So do do you have?</v>

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:59.180
<v Sujai Kumar>Do you want all the filters which are currently above, or can we replace any of the filter?</v>

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:00.940
<v Amanda Colon>Umm can you go?</v>

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:01.160
<v Amanda Colon>Uh.</v>

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:09.520
<v Amanda Colon>Perfect vendor code, vendor state, SCAC performance, market type.</v>

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.030
<v Amanda Colon>I don't think we can replace any.</v>

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:19.840
<v Sujai Kumar>OK.</v>

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:24.430
<v Sujai Kumar>Umm.</v>

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:27.380
<v Amanda Colon>There's one that's a maybe, but I know two months down the road and they're like, man, I wish I wouldn't have asked them to remove that.</v>

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:29.260
<v Jamal Asif>You know.</v>

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.610
<v Sujai Kumar>No, no issues.</v>

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:33.170
<v Sujai Kumar>I mean that will will I just check out English and we'll add it.</v>

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:33.300
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:34.830
<v Amanda Colon>Thank you.</v>

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.030
<v Jamal Asif>OK, we'll try to include them.</v>

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.500
<v Jamal Asif>So one more filter for a network, yeah.</v>

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:47.290
<v Sujai Kumar>They were the last one.</v>

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.010
<v Cheri S Rhodes>I like this next visual.</v>

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:49.820
<v Cheri S Rhodes>That's really nice.</v>

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:51.100
<v Jamal Asif>There's one.</v>

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.180
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah, me too.</v>

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:53.080
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah.</v>

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:55.010
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, I pick up stay and then.</v>

00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:00.890
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Separates shipment type by the the average by the score.</v>

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.450
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah, the base and the pickup state shipment type, yes.</v>

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.750
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Look at Idaho to Alaska.</v>

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.420
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Ohh, I hope that's only one shipment.</v>

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:08.550
<v Amanda Colon>No surprise there.</v>

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.060
<v Amanda Colon>Hopefully me too, Sherry.</v>

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.250
<v Amanda Colon>I hope we're not we.</v>

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.390
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Is it if in the tool tip is there shipment count?</v>

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:24.280
<v Jamal Asif>Sorry, sorry, sorry.</v>

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:24.460
<v Sujai Kumar>Just fun.</v>

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:27.060
<v Sujai Kumar>Do we have shipment count and?</v>

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:31.380
<v Cheri S Rhodes>In the tool tip, it is their shipment count, just as a just being absolutely curious.</v>

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.680
<v Jamal Asif>No, only the scores we have, yeah.</v>

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:35.570
<v Cheri S Rhodes>OK, OK.</v>

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:39.800
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, so it won't.</v>

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:43.210
<v Jamal Asif>It's a metric table, so using the metrics table we just using the condition formatting to showcasing the numbers.</v>

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:44.820
<v Cheri S Rhodes>OK, OK.</v>

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.180
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, if you just click on it.</v>

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:54.380
<v Amanda Colon>If you I think we could answer that question for you, though Sherry couldn't we just change it at the top to just Idaho, right?</v>

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:57.700
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Uh, but if you if you click on it, all the other visuals will change.</v>

00:31:58.660 --> 00:31:59.150
<v Amanda Colon>OK.</v>

00:31:59.220 --> 00:31:59.390
<v Amanda Colon>Yeah.</v>

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.590
<v Amanda Colon>So I don't have to change out the filter.</v>

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.950
<v Cheri S Rhodes>So it would umm.</v>

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:03.130
<v Jamal Asif>Yeah.</v>

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.420
<v Amanda Colon>Gotcha.</v>

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:07.500
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Very cool.</v>

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:07.750
<v Jamal Asif>So if you wanted to click any scores, it will be changing all the visuals.</v>

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.490
<v Amanda Colon>OK, yeah.</v>

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:09.900
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah, very cool.</v>

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:15.160
<v Amanda Colon>Thanks.</v>

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:18.590
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Yeah.</v>

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.910
<v Cheri S Rhodes>We don't want anything out of Connecticut.</v>

<v Cheri S Rhodes>That's good.</v>

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.000
<v Amanda Colon>That that's a good result.</v>

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:28.980
<v Amanda Colon>That's the result we would like to see a blank for loose load anyway.</v>

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.360
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Ohh yes, it's for shipments, yeah.</v>

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:32.940
<v Amanda Colon>For too many.</v>

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:34.780
<v Cheri S Rhodes>Interesting.</v>

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.770

<v Amanda Colon>Can we?</v>

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:52.990
<v Jamal Asif>That the only change is is time period which we used here for required delivery date and the actual delivery date.</v>

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.660
<v Jamal Asif>So rest are there all the same.</v>

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.040
<v Amanda Colon>Umm.</v>

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:06.470

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:29.170
